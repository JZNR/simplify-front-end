# Simplify

### Description

Simplify is a Calendar and simple note-taking app for personal use. It was built using MongoDB, Express, React, Node and the Fullcalendar npm package.

The main reason to create Simplify Calendar, was to create a Calendar and App with a simple to use UI and this is why we picked the name "Simplify".

### UX/UI

To reach our goal of creating a simple to use UI for the best experience when using the app, we have implemented easy to use features such as Drag & Drop and we have created the designs in Figma.
